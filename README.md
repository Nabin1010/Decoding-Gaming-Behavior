# Decoding-Gaming-Behavior
This repository contains SQL solutions for the virtual internship project "Decoding Gaming Behaviors" provided by the company Mentorness. The project involves analyzing gaming behaviors and answering a series of 15-20 questions using SQL queries.

## Project Description

In this virtual internship project, I explore gaming behaviors using SQL queries to derive insights and answer specific questions related to player activity, game performance, user engagement, and more. The dataset used for analysis contains information about game sessions, player actions, in-game purchases, and other relevant metrics.
